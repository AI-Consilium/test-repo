# Add support for date difference calculation

We need to add a function in src/index.ts to calculate the difference between two dates. This will help in implementing features that require date manipulation. If additional utility functions are required, they should be added to src/utils/dateUtils.ts.

## Implementation Progress
- [ ] Create a new function calculateDateDifference in src/index.ts
- [ ] Ensure the function correctly calculates the difference between two dates
