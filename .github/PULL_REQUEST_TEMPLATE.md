# Add support for date difference calculation

We need to add a function to calculate the difference between two dates in the src/index.ts file. This will help users easily compute time intervals.

## Implementation Progress
- [ ] Create a new function called calculateDateDifference that takes two date objects as parameters and returns the difference in milliseconds.
- [ ] Implement the logic to compute the difference between the two dates, considering both positive and negative differences.
- [ ] Export the calculateDateDifference function from the src/index.ts file.
